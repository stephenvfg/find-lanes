# Description

This repository contains the files for a project from the [Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). The goal of this project was to take a video input stream of a car driving down a highway and to use image processing techniques to identify and highlight the lanes on the road.
